# pig_assembler

Prompt:

Create a assembler program to allow two players to play a game of pig.  
The page linked to includes the rules of the game as well as the ability to play against the computer or another player. 
For learning the game, I would recommend playing against the computer - it is easier to keep track of whose turn it is when playing against the computer.  
You will only handle two people playing, don't worry about trying to implement a computer player.  
Note that you will want to use the RandomRange procedure that is part of the Irivne32 library.
